#  	     - Pink → PINK

#  	     - Bus numbers → WHITE (default)
# 		 - Multiple routes (Brn|P) = fetches both lines, merges arrivals, shows up to 2 times
# label: Short display name (max 6 chars, e.g., "ToLoop", "22Nrth")
# stops: Pipe-separated stop IDs (map IDs for trains, stop IDs for buses)
#        Multiple stops = "any of these stations" (shows earliest arrival)
# min_time: Minimum minutes to display (hide arrivals closer than this)
# commute_hours: Optional. Pipe-separated time ranges in 24h format (e.g., "6-9|16-19")
#        Shows only during these hours. Omit or use empty string for always show.
# days: Optional - defaults to "weekday" (Mon-Fri) if omitted. Options: "weekday", "weekend", "all"
#       Can also use specific days as numbers: "0,1,2" (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
#
# Example configurations:
# train,Red,ToLoop,40900|41380,3,6-9|16-19,weekday
# bus,22,22Nrth,1234,5,6-9|16-19,weekday
# train,Brn|P,South,40530,3,6-10,weekday  # Brown/Purple split color
#
# Multiple stops example (Red Line northbound from either Howard or Jarvis):
# train,Red,North,40900|40100,3,,all
#
# Notes:
# - Times use 24-hour format (0-23)
# - End hour is EXCLUSIVE (6-9 means 6:00-8:59)
# - Empty commute_hours shows route all day
# - Empty for days shows weekdays
# - min_time prevents "Train arriving in 1 min" clutter when you can't make it
# - Maximum 3 routes can be displayed at a time, based on .csv order all others will be ignored
